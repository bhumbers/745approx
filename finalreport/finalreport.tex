\section{Introduction}

Approximate computing is a method of computation that sacrifices accuracy for computation time and energy. For certain problems, a large degree of precision may not be necessary, and the savings gained in battery life or power costs may be worth more than the accuracy lost. In particular, we are inspired by the RoboCup code, where speed in decision-making trades off with the optimality of the final decision. Approximate compilation is a promising way of implementing approximate computation that can be done on current machines.

In this project, we take several C functions and
